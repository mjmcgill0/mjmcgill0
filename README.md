Hi!  My name is Matt McGillen. 
I'm currently a practicing Physical Therapist, as well as a Software Engineer in-training. 
I've been an outpatient Physical Therapist for just over 4 years with experience in orthopedics, neurology, & vestibular rehab, but decided that a career in programming was more aligned with my interests and would allow me to better flex my creative muscle.  

Over the next few months, I will be completing an accelerated bootcamp in full-stack Python & MERN development.  

I'm passionate about finding solutions to user problems through elegant coding & design, and am skilled in responsive web development using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.  

I would love to work for a health-care technology company where I can combine my experience as a Physical Therapist with my knowledge & skills in programming to improve patient care in a broad & efficient way, but am open to all opportunities to apply my full-stack knowledge and continue to learn.
